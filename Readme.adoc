= Learning test for HAL browser

== Abstract
This project shows how to make beautiful REST API with documentation and quick testing with HAL Browser.

== Spring Data REST HAL Browser
Spring package spring-data-rest-hal-browser comes with lot of things out of the box, but there are some crucial things that are missing.

=== Problems with Spring Data REST and Spring Data REST HAL Browser:
. Spring Data REST HAL Browser works only with Spring Data REST.
. Spring Data REST has problem with POST-ing invalid data. Instead of returning Bed Request HTTP status it returns Internal error (HTTP Status 500).
. Spring Data REST also doesn't support extending autogenerated documentation with custom controllers.

When adding up all problems Spring Data REST and Spring Data REST HAL Browser become unusable in real world projects, but they do make good reference when looklin how to make usable REST API with HAL links.

== Explanation of shortcuts

HAL - Hypertext Application Language - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language[HAL Wikipedia]
ALPS - Application-Level Profile Semantics - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Level_Profile_Semantics_(ALPS)[ALPS Wikipedia]
CURIE - Compact URI - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE[CURIE Wikipedia]

== Better way
HAL Browser should be outside of a project and provided by Docker image. That way you can target localhost while developing REST API for quick check, and then later you can target your project in separate docker container.

Project should link to API documentation created with Spring REST Docs library.
