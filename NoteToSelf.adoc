= Note to self

This feature is done but Postman has problem when getting Authorization token on unsigned certificate.

So one way is to wait for Postman to fix this issue (https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5819).
And other way would be to figure out how to add certificate to postman. I have tried it to do it blindly but I failed.

I should learn how keystores and certificates work and get back to it, but for now I will skip this feature.
